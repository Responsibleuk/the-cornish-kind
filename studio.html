    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Identify limiting beliefs</h3>
        <p>During the first few months of working with your life coach, you will work with your coach to identify
          limiting beliefs that are holding you back from unlocking an extraordinary life. Before you can tackle
          goals in your career, relationship or
          health, you must first do inner work to develop a greater understanding of yourself, your habits and how
          you
          view yourself and the world.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Overcoming the limiting beliefs</h3>
        <p>The next three to six months of work with your life or business coach will focus on developing patterns
          to
          help you overcome these beliefs and achieve breakthroughs. These patterns will become regular habits that
          you can use for the rest of your life.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Reinforce patterns and achieve goals</h3>
        <p>The rest of your work with your personal life coach will focus on reinforcing your new patterns and using
          them to achieve the goals you set in the beginning of your coaching program. As you achieve goals, your
          life
          coach will celebrate your successes with you and help you set new goals to tackle.</p>

        <h2>Diet</h2>
        <h5 class="diet-text">Switching to a plant based diet will reduce your carbon footprint and improve your health.
          A diet centered around plants can yield significant performance advantages, providing optimal fuel, increasing
          blood flow, making muscles more efficient, and speeding recovery by lowering inflammation. These benefits can
          not only be experienced by athletes, but by anyone who wants to feel and perform better in any aspect of their
          lives.</h5>

        <h5 class="exercise-text">Want to learn how to enjoy exercise? It all starts with examining your beliefs
          and replacing negative beliefs with empowering ones. Many of your beliefs were set in childhood. If you
          participated in boring P.E. classes or were forced to do a sport that wasn’t for you, you likely developed the
          belief that working out was something to be endured instead of enjoyed. We will change that.</h5>
